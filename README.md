## App Brainstorming 

1. Google Calendar

It has a user-friendly interface that facilitates quick and easy interactionâ€”in other words, it is convenient to find what I am looking for, and the design really makes it easy to navigate. In terms of features, the app meets the need for all of my tasks, like adding a to-do item, adding items to my schedule, separating between different schedules, booking a meeting, etc.

2. Instagram

Also an app that has a user-friendly interface. It also has cool features like posting images/videos to the site, adding stories, seeing other people's content, editing images, etc.

3. Discord

It has all of the features needed for a messaging app, plus additional ones. It allows users to switch between channels and engage in conversations, voice calls or video calls. Also has game-specific features, which I have not been able to try out yet.

4. My app ideas:

Birdlife is an app for people sharing concern for endangered bird species near where they live and wanting to make direct contributions to organizations that host bird protection activities.

Features:

- Allow users to make donation
- Sign up for any related events
- Search for any specific species and related campaigns

## Notes

- Need to connect to a database on bird species in order to display the relevant details 

- Geolocating the area of user to identify any local campaigns
- Account payment for donations
